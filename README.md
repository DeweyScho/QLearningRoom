# QlearningRoom

A basic tabular Q-learning implementation where an agent learns to navigate a custom room/grid environment using reward-based exploration and value iteration.

Files:
- QLearningRoom.py — Main script (environment setup and agent interaction)
- QLearning.py — Q-learning algorithm and update loop

Note: checkpoint saving is not implemented — no model or Q-table persistence is required.

Install with command:
pip install numpy
